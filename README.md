# Checklr
---

A simple checklist web application based upon vanilla JavaScript.

This repository is meant to build on JavaScript skills, CSS preprocessor skills, Gulp skills, NPM skills, and Git skills.

I am very open to suggestions on how the code could be better.

## Built Using
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. (Vanilla) JavaScript

## Technologies Utilized
1. Gulp, coupled with NPM.
  1. gulp-connect (LiveReload)
  2. gulp-htmlbuild (Build of HTML files)
  3. gulp-imagebin (Compression of image files)
  4. gulp-plumber (JavaScript error handling)
  5. gulp-ruby-sass (Compiler and minifier of SCSS into CSS)
  6. gulp-uglify (Inactive, but used to beautify, compress, and minify JavaScript files)
2. Git
3. SASS/SCSS, specifically SCSS.

## Roadmap
I eventually want to integrate the following into the project.
* Bootstrap
* Bower (To handle depencies).
* HTML5 APIs.
* Possibly jQuery or AngularJS to build the app out in a more modern fashion.
